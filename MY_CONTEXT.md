# MY_CONTEXT.md

## Who Am I
**Shravan Revanna** - The guy who automates the unautomatable  
**Current Gig:** SDE Intern at udaanCapital (building risk assessment systems)  
**Location:** Bengaluru (where the good coffee and better code lives)  
**Reach me:** shravanrevanna@gmail.com | +91 9945332995  

## What I Actually Do
I'm that developer who sees a manual process and thinks "nah, let's automate this." Currently neck-deep in maintainging and optimising onboarding systems at udaanCapital, but my real passion? Building stuff that makes people's lives easier, and a lots and lots of scripts.

Been shipping production code since 2022. Built 150+ projects (yeah, I counted) with 187 Repos on GitHub, and most of them actually matter. I don't just write code - I solve problems that annoy me enough to fix them.

## The Stack I Live In
**Languages I Think In:** Python (my first love), JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin  
**Frameworks That Don't Suck:** Next.js, React, Node.js  
**AI/ML Stuff:** I've been playing with LLMs since before they were cool - Mistral 7B, Llama 2, RAG applications, ChromaDB  
**Databases & Cloud:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, AWS S3  
**DevOps Because Someone Has To:** Docker, Kubernetes  

## Current Day Job

### udaanCapital (Jul 2025 - Present)
Working with onboarding systems. Making sure the application gets converted the right way. Optimizing performance because slow code is bad code.

### What I Did at Udaan (Jun 2024 - May 2025)
- Built features in Kotlin & TypeScript across multiple consoles
- Automated competitor APIs - cut setup errors by 70%
- Made pricing pipelines that actually stay up (99% uptime, because that 1% keeps you humble)
- Enhanced data workflows because messy data is the enemy

## Projects That Actually Matter

### NoteRep - The Study Material Site Everyone Uses
**The Numbers:** 200+ active users, 85K+ views (and counting)  
**What It Is:** Students needed notes. I built a platform. Now everyone uses it before exams.  
**The Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, AI chatbot that actually helps  
**Cool Features:** 
- AI chatbot that knows everything about the site (monitised and ads integrated because why not?)
- Community-driven content (students upload, students benefit)
- CGPA predictor (spoiler: it's ~90% accuracy)
- Real-time class schedules
- Mini SIS that scrapes all academics details from the college portal (old garbage php system)

### F&B System That Actually Works
**The Numbers:** 2000+ monthly users, 100+ daily orders  
**What It Is:** QR-based restaurant ordering. Scan, order, eat. No waiting for menus.  
**The Tech:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, 70+ APIs, AWS S3  
**Why It's Cool:** 
- Real-time everything (orders, kitchen updates, waiter notifications)
- Three dashboards: customer, kitchen, management
- Digital billing with GST (because taxes are inevitable)
- Actually sold this one - it's running in production

### HDFC Account Explorer - Bank Statements But Better
**What It Is:** Upload your HDFC statements, get insights that actually matter  
**The Tech:** React, PostgreSQL, AI integration via MCP  
**Cool Stuff:**
- Merges multiple statements like magic
- AI chat that understands your spending
- Community tagging (crowdsourced transaction categories)
- B-trees for date queries because O(log n) > O(n)

## AI Projects That Don't Suck

### AI Meal Planner (37 Stars on GitHub)
**What It Does:** Tell it your stats, get a meal plan that won't kill you  
**The Magic:** Llama 70B + knapsack algorithm for optimal nutrition  
**Why It's Smart:** Uses dynamic programming to hit calorie targets perfectly  
**Link:** [ai-meal-planner.streamlit.app](https://ai-meal-planner.streamlit.app/)

### EnigmaEscape - The AI Manipulation Game
**The Challenge:** Make an AI say specific phrases without asking directly  
**The Tech:** Streamlit, Llama-2-70b, Firebase  
**Why It's Fun:** It's like social engineering but for LLMs  
**Link:** [enigma-escape-bot.streamlit.app](https://enigma-escape-bot.streamlit.app/)

### VigilAI - IoT Health Monitoring
**The Problem:** Elderly care is expensive and impersonal  
**The Solution:** ESP32 + sensors + AI = affordable health monitoring  
**The Tech:** ESP32, Python, Firebase, TensorFlow Lite  
**Cool Features:** Fall detection, vitals tracking, anomaly alerts

## The Fun Stuff (Where I Really Geek Out)

### Restaurant Table Booking Bot
**The Problem:** Naru Noodles books out in 2 minutes. Humans are too slow.  
**The Solution:** Python + Selenium automation  
**The Result:** Never missed a reservation again  
**Blog:** [Read how I built it](https://shravanrevanna.hashnode.dev/automating-the-unautomatable-how-i-built-a-python-bot-to-snag-coveted-restaurant-reservations)

### IPL Ticket Booking Automation
**The Problem:** RCB tickets disappear faster than their chances in playoffs  
**The Solution:** Python script that books tickets while I sleep  
**Blog:** [The RCB ticket heist](https://shravanrevanna.hashnode.dev/automating-the-ipl-ticket-booking-for-rcb-match)

### Arbitrage Betting Scraper
**What It Does:** WebSocket scraper for Parimatch odds + arbitrage detection  
**Why:** Math doesn't lie, bookmakers do  
**Status:** For educational purposes only (wink wink)

### College Portal Security Testing
**DOB Finder SIS:** Brute-force script that exposed security flaws  
**Purpose:** Ethical security testing (with permission)  
**Result:** College fixed their auth system

### Student Life Automation
- **GetPlaced:** Organizes placement emails so you don't miss opportunities
- **Calculla:** GPA calculator that tells you exactly what scores you need
- **Campus Queries:** Report campus problems without bureaucracy
- **IntelliFind:** Lost & found that actually works

### AI Tools I Built for Fun
- **FastIQ:** Multi-API LLM playground with community prompt templates
- **Syllabus GPT:** Ask questions about any subject, get real answers
- **NoteRep AI Chatbot:** Groq-powered assistant that's actually helpful

## Work History (The Learning Journey)

### CADRE ODR - ML Intern (Jan 2024 - Apr 2024)
Built a grievance system using ChromaDB + Mistral 7B. Fine-tuned BART for government department classification. Turns out AI can navigate bureaucracy better than humans.

### NextWealth - GenAI Intern (Oct 2023 - Jan 2024)
Automated document processing, saved 5 minutes per task. Eliminated entire QC layers through AI. Built prototypes that solved real client problems.

### Foodingo - Full Stack Dev (Jun 2022 - Aug 2023)
My first real gig. Built backend architecture and admin panels. Learned that role-based access control is harder than it looks.

## Education & Other Stuff
**BE in CSE (AI & ML)** from M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (2021-2025)  
**CGPA:** 8.81/10 (not bad for someone who spent more time building than studying)

**Vice President, E-Cell Ramaiah** - Leading the entrepreneurship club because someone has to teach students that building > talking

## What Makes Me Different
- **I ship code, not promises:** 150+ projects, many in production
- **Automation is my religion:** If it's manual, I'll make it automatic
- **AI before it was cool:** Been building with LLMs since 2023
- **Problem-first mindset:** I don't build tech demos, I solve real problems
- **Production mindset:** My code serves real users with real needs

## The Writing Side
**Blog:** [shravanrevanna.hashnode.dev](https://shravanrevanna.hashnode.dev/)  
I write about the stuff I build, the problems I solve, and the automation scripts that make life easier. Real stories, not corporate fluff.

## Current Status
**Looking for:** Roles where I can build systems that matter  
**Interested in:** GenAI engineering, full-stack development, anything involving automation  
**Loves:** Building things from scratch 0 to 1 and making them scale

## Philosophy
Code should solve problems. Automation should eliminate tedium. AI should augment human capability, not replace human judgment. And if something can be automated, it probably should be.

I don't build for the sake of building. I build because there's a problem that needs solving, and code is the best tool for the job.

With AI x -> 10x but you need that x and strong fundaments is a niche then you can take the decision to use AI to enhance your work.  

AI can't build thinking for the very long term and you have the context and experience to make that decision.

## TL;DR
I'm Shravan, a developer who automates the unautomatable. I build AI-powered applications and full-stack solutions that solve real problems. With 150+ projects under my belt, I'm currently focused on making onboarding systems at udaanCapital better and faster. I write about tech, build tools that save time, and love creating things that matter. Let's connect if you want to build something great together.
