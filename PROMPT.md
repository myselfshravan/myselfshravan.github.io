# Portfolio Website Revamp - Professional Hacker Aesthetic

## Context
I need you to completely revamp my portfolio website to have a more mature, professional "casual hacker" vibe. The current version feels childish and unprofessional. Please refer to MY_CONTEXT.md for detailed information about me.

## Current Issues to Fix
- Content tone is too childish (especially "My Mission" section and achievement numbers)
- Lacks clear project descriptions that explain what each project actually does
- Too much irrelevant content (hobbies, extensive skills lists, academic highlights)
- Doesn't immediately communicate that I build projects and write tech blogs
- Home page is cluttered with unnecessary sections
- Not selling my technical abilities effectively

## Design Philosophy & Tone
- **Casual Hacker Aesthetic**: Think clean, minimal, with subtle tech/terminal vibes
- **Professional but Approachable**: Mature enough for potential employers/clients
- **Content-First**: Focus on what I've built and written, not fluff
- **Minimal Home Page**: Should immediately show I'm a builder and writer
- **Technical Credibility**: Showcase real technical achievements

## Content Strategy

### Home Page (Minimal & Focused)
- Brief, impactful intro that immediately establishes me as a technical builder
- Highlight key achievements (180+ projects, current role at Udaan, AI/ML focus)
- Featured projects section with 1-line descriptions that explain what each project does
- Recent blog posts section to show I write about tech
- Quick links to work experience and contact
- Remove: hobbies, extensive skills lists, academic info, childish mission statements

### About Page (Consolidated Info)
- Professional journey and technical background
- Consolidated skills section (brief, not keyword-stuffed)
- Personal interests (minimal, if included at all)
- Technical philosophy/approach

### Projects Page
- Each project needs a clear and proper 1-line description explaining its purpose/value
- Group by type: AI/ML projects, Full-stack apps, Tools/Scripts
- Include tech stack and impact metrics where relevant
- Link to live demos and GitHub repos

### Work Experience
- Keep concise but impactful
- Focus on technical achievements and business impact
- Remove academic details unless directly relevant

## Specific Content Updates Needed

### Remove These Sections:
- "My Mission" with the childish tone
- Achievement counter numbers (180+ projects, etc.) - integrate naturally into copy instead
- Extensive education section and academic highlights
- "Hobbies & Interests" from home page
- Overly detailed skills showcase

### Add/Improve These:
- Clear project descriptions (each explaining what it does)
- Blog/writing prominence on home page
- More technical depth in project descriptions
- Professional work impact statements
- Streamlined contact section

### Content Tone Examples:
- Instead of: "What have I created? Let me tell you, I've built a lots of websites..."
- Write: "I build AI-powered applications and full-stack solutions that solve real problems."

- Instead of: "My Goal is to Contribute to as many open source project as possible..."
- Write: "I contribute to meaningful projects and build tools that save people time."

## Deliverables
1. Revamped home page with minimal, impactful design
2. Updated content with professional tone throughout
3. Clear project descriptions that explain value/purpose
4. Consolidated about page with relevant personal/professional info

## Success Criteria
- First impression clearly communicates I'm a technical builder and writer
- Professional enough for job applications and client work
- Casual enough to show personality without being unprofessional
- Clear value proposition and technical credibility
- Easy to navigate and find relevant information

Please analyze the current codebase, understand the structure, and implement these changes while maintaining the existing technical setup. Focus on content strategy and design improvements that reflect a more mature, professional developer portfolio.
